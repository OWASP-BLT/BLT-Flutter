2. Abuse or excessively frequent requests to Bugheist via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your account's access to the API. Bugheist, in its sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. Bugheist will make a reasonable attempt via email to warn the account owner prior to suspension.

3. Bugheist reserves the right at any time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, your access to the API (or any part thereof) with or without notice.
