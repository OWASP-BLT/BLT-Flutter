# Contribution Guide
Thinking of contributing to BLT's mobile app? Here's a comprehensive guide to let you join in the fun of the open source world!

### Understanding BLT
To be able to contribute to the BLT app, you must understand the project, BLT first. To iterate the basics, BLT is a bug logging tool which enables the users (i.e., one of you!) to share the common bugs you find while you surf over the hundreds of different websites or apps. This knowledge of the presence of a bug enables the developers to fix them quickly and thus enhance your browsing experience on that website or that app. This is not the end, you also get rewarded for finding bugs and can also get rewarded in case you are on the top leaderboards of a bug hunt organized by various companies on BLT! 

Open Source FTW!

### This Repository
All of the BLT app's code is in this repository.

### The BLT repository repository
To keep things mantaibale, the website's frontend, backend, and the API's code is in The [BLT repository.](https://github.com/OWASP/BLT)

### Time to contribute!
Too much talkin', let's get to the business, yes? We welcome both developers and designers, so we have something for both of you!

#### _If you are a developer_

Follow the steps below, and you'll be able to set up the dev environment in no time!
- Go to the [OWASP/BLT-Flutter](https://github.com/OWASP/BLT-Flutter) repository.
- Clone the repository, run `git clone https://github.com/OWASP/BLT-Flutter` (you can use any way of your choice).
- Open the project in an editor of your choice, and then run `flutter run` from the current working directory. ([Haven't installed flutter?](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) or are [new to flutter?](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab))

If you were able to build the app, then you're all set! Check the next section on what to do next.

#### _If you are a designer_
We value a good user experience empowered by good design practices. You can view the current UI mockups implemented for the app in the below attached Figma file. You can submit your suggestions here on discussions; if your suggestions are ideal, we'll add them to the design file.

### Dev, Set, GO!
If you have set up the dev environment, what are you waiting for? You can do so much! Need a good starting point? Go through the list of [issues](https://github.com/OWASP/BLT-Flutter/issues) on the repository! Have a great new idea that you implemented and want it in the app? [Make a PR](https://github.com/OWASP/BLT-Flutter/pulls), and we'll be sure to consider it! One last thing, while suggesting a screen, please follow the design schemes in the above-shared design file, and make sure that &emsp; `flutter analyze` works before submitting that hard-worked pull request of yours!

#### _Looking forward to what you do!_
